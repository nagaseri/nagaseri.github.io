		<!-- About Me -->
		<p>Hello! My name is Eri and I am a Japan born, Hawaii raised, UC Berkeley grad. I absolutely love to travel, meet new people, eat all the food that the world has to offer, and dance! Although I have my BA in Psychology, I am now pursuing a career change and going into Web Development. I fell into this field because I was looking for a job where I could work remotely so that I could continue traveling. I happened upon coding and found a genuine sense of excitement when I was dabbling in it. I hope to become an expert web developer by the end of the program.</p>
